# Galaga? 

## ToDo

### Game things
* Rather then side to side enemies actually go downwards mostly
  * one of them is basically a kamikaze pilot
    * this requires to check collision between players and enemies

### Random

### Rendering
* Create one large image and be able to parse it
* font bitmap
    * differentiate between static and dynamic text rendering
    * fix to text actually looks good

### Data
* Figure out how we parse UI data from file
    * hoist out pretty much every data to a file :)

### UI
* Layout
  * Able to render lists of element
  * Implicit rendering of element
